1) Try / Catch then throwing a generic exception - why? Generic exceptions changed to more specific ones.
2) Tightly coupled repositories and csvwriter. 
3) Everything is internal, which means unit tests would need to be in the same assembly, normally I would make a separate project for unit tests. May need discussion as to whether acceptable to make these classes public. 
4) Very exception happy. Would probably change this to a log with meaningful error messages to identify problems.
5) Hardcoded strings for filenames or filename partials, may want to be added to config so changeable at runtime.
6) Simplify supplier bacs export code
7) Simplify payments export code
8) Could put a wrapper around DocumentStore incase this dependency changes
9) string.IsNullOrEmpty(transactionGroup.First().InvoiceRef) First() will throw exception if no elements, replace with FirstOrDefault() or perform null check first.
10) BuildSupplierPayments has a lot of inline checks, for code readability I would split these out.
11) Some comments would be nice.
12) BuildSupplierPayments and BuildAgencyPayments followed by ExportZip is where I would focus unit test coverage. See how it copes with shoddy data and put in appropriate guard code to make it more resilient.
13) Could write another implementation of IExportFileWriter for unit testing which doesn't have the csvwriter dependency
